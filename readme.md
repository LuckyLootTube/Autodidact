This is what I was able to put together recently. It is a cute timer that shows up the remaining time until LuckyLootTube will be LIVE again and host its FREE Giveaway Events.

Feel free to fork it and use it for your own projects.

The timer itself is designed to last 2 weeks, and reset itself one hour after its depleted. You can modify that in main.js (look for countdown).
The only downside is that I am struggling with making it mobile friendly... So, maybe you can teach me how to do that :D
