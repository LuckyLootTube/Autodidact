I recently managed to put this together.
It is not "created" by me, as I only took pieces from here and there and slam them together into a cool little project that now serves as LuckyLootTube's official countdown timer.
Another cool aspect is that I've also played around with GitHub Pages which was a great experience as now it does work flawlesly.
So this gorgeous timer counts down to when LuckyLootTube will be LIVE again and ready to host its FREE Giveaway Events.

You are welcome to fork it, edit it, and utilize it in your own interests. You don't have to like, or subscribe, give me credits, or anyhting else, just fork it and enjoy it. :)

The timer itself has a two-week lifespan and automatically resets itself after one hour. That's something you can change in main.js (search for countdown).

The only drawback is that I am having difficulties making it responsive to mobile devices (it kinda is, but not really) :D.
So perhaps you could show me how to accomplish it. :D

Enjoy!
From LuckyLootTube with love <3
